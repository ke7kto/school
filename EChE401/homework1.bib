	abstract={Abstract Co diffusion in Cu was studied by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The samples were annealed at the temperature range 600–800 °C (0.65–0.8Tm – Cu melting temperature). The Co concentration was measured along grain boundary (GB) in adjacent to GB region and far from it. It was shown that Co concentration does not depend on the distance from GB at the same depth. This result indicates the absence of the accelerated GB diffusion. The possible reasons for such unexpected result can be connected with the gradient of GB surface tension as the additional driving force for GB diffusion. The last effect is related the increasing of Cu GB surface tension on Co concentration.},

	abstract={Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to determine the isotope effect on diffusion in SiO2 and MgSiO3 liquids. The influence of an element's atomic mass on its diffusivity can be expressed in terms of the empirical relation D-1/D-2 = (m(2)/m(1))(beta). For Si, beta has a value of similar to 0.05 in both SiO2 and MgSiO3 liquids, and is independent of pressure. The exponent beta for Mg in MgSiO3 is larger, 0.135 at 1 atm, and decreases with pressure, to 0.084 at 50 GPa. Varying the mass and concentration of an isotope of one element is also found to have a significant influence on the diffusivity of other elements, due to the cooperative motions of the many atoms that are involved in diffusion. Interdiffusion between basaltic and rhyolitic magmas is inferred to be capable of producing isotope fractionations of tenths of per mil in Si, and tens of per mil in Mg. Significant diffusive fractionation of Si and Mg isotopes is also possible during the growth of olivine phenocrysts, if the growth rate is on the order of cm/ yr or faster. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract={Laser-ablation ICPMS has become widely accessible as a powerful and efficient multi-element microanalytical technique. One of its key strengths is the ability to analyse a wide concentration range from major (tens of wt.%) to trace (ng/g) levels in minerals and their microscopic inclusions. An ArF excimer laser system (lambda = 193 nm) with imaging optics for controlled UV ablation and simultaneous petrographic viewing was designed specifically for representative sampling and quantitative multi-element analysis of microscopic fluid, melt and mineral inclusions beneath the sample surface. After a review of the requirements and recent technical developments, results are presented which together document the reliability and reproducibility of quantitative microanalysis of complex samples such as zoned crystals or fluid and melt inclusions in various host minerals. Analytical errors due to elemental fractionation are reduced to the typical precision achieved by quadrupole LA-ICPMS in multi-element mode (2-5% RSD). This progress is largely due to the small size of aerosol particles generated by the optimized UV optical system. Depth profiling yields representative and accurate concentration results at a resolution of similar to0.1 mum perpendicular to the ablation surface. Ablation is largely matrix-insensitive for different elements, such that silicate and borate glasses, silicates and oxide minerals, or direct liquid ablation can be used interchangeably for external standardization of any homogeneous or heterogeneous material. The absolute ablation rate is material dependent, however, so that quantitative LA-ICPMS analysis requires an internal standard (i.e., an independent constraint such as the absolute concentration of one element). Our approach to quantifying fluid and melt inclusion compositions is described in detail. Experiments with synthetic fluid inclusions show that accurate results are obtained by combining the LA-ICPMS analysis of element concentration ratios with a microthermometric measurement of the NaCl equivalent concentration and an empirical description of the effect of major cations on the final melting temperatures of ice, hydrohalite or halite. Expected calibration errors for NaCl-H2O-dominated fluids are smaller than the typical analytical scatter within an assemblage of simultaneously trapped fluid inclusions. Analytical precision is limited by representative ablation of all phases in heterogeneous inclusions and the integration of transient ICPMS signals, to typically +/-10 to 20% RSD. Element concentrations in devitrified and even coarsely crystallized silicate melt inclusions can be reconstituted from LA-ICPMS signals. Deconvolution of inclusion and host signals with internal standardization automatically corrects for sidewall crystallization after melt entrapment at high temperature. A test using melt inclusions in a midocean ridge basalt, a summary of published geochemical studies and a new application to REE analysis of coexisting fluids and mineral phases in carbonatite-related veins illustrate the versatility and some of the strengths and limitations of LA-ICPMS, in comparison with other microanalytical techniques.

The scaling analysis reveals that network forming elements (Si and O) fractionate significantly less than network modifiers (e. g., Mg, Ca, Fe, Sr, Hf, and U).},

	abstract={An extension of the Fisher model of grain boundary diffusion is suggested, in which the diffusion along the short-circuit paths in the bulk of the crystalline grains (dislocations, subgrain boundaries, interphase boundaries in the lamellar structures) is taken into account. In the framework of the suggested model the bulk is treated as a stochastic mixture of defect-free crystalline regions and regions of bad material inside the short-circuit paths. The Harrison classification of the diffusion regimes is extended to the new D-regime, in which the kinetics of the penetration of the diffusing element along the grain boundaries is dominated by diffusion along these short-circuit paths. Three different kinetic modes during the grain boundary diffusion in the D-regime are uncovered: for the short annealing times the penetration kinetics follows the Whipple law, but with the bulk diffusion coefficient substituted by g(2)D(d), for the intermediate annealing times the penetration distance along the grain boundary is a weak function of lime and for the long limes the Whipple law is valid again, but with the bulk diffusion coefficient substituted by gD(d), where g and D-d are the volume fraction of the material inside the short-circuit paths and the diffusion coefficient along them, respectively. The applications of the suggested model to the analysis of experimental data are discussed. (C) 1999 Acta Metallurgica Inc. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For the usual experimental conditions, approximate analytical solutions of the model appear to coincide in form with those of Fisher's uniform isotropic slab model, but the role of the boundary diffusion coefficient and the boundary width is played by respective effective quantities related to the local diffusion behaviour. The accuracy of the analytical solutions obtained is estimated by comparing with the results of finite-difference calculations on the basis of exact diffusion equations. The model may be used for relating experimentally measured grain boundary diffusion characteristics to the results of modelling atomic jumps along grain boundaries.},

	abstract={Grain boundary networks in polycrystalline materials are heterogeneous and comprise a spectrum of local boundary diffusivities. Although it is desirable to ascribe a single “effective” grain boundary diffusivity to a polycrystal, this quantity is a complex average over the grain boundary character distribution, in view of the network topology and connectivity among boundaries of different character. Here we evaluate the macroscopic diffusivity of grain boundary networks with both randomly distributed and crystallographically correlated grain boundary character. In high-contrast networks, where the local diffusivity varies by more than four orders of magnitude between grain boundaries of different character, the macroscopic diffusivity is governed by the development of a percolating path of high-diffusivity boundaries. In low-contrast systems, the effective network diffusivity is less sensitive to topology and can be described by composite averaging schemes. We quantitatively delineate high- and low-contrast regimes, and discuss a generalized effective medium approximation that quantitatively links the network structure to effective macroscopic transport properties at all levels of contrast. We also illustrate how effective medium theory can be adapted to capture crystallographic correlations among boundary types, and expanded to include a broader spectrum of boundary character.},

	abstract={We investigate atomic mechanisms of grain boundary (GB) diffusion by combining molecular dynamics (MD), molecular statics, the harmonic approximation to atomic vibrations, and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations. The most important aspects of this approach are the basin-constrained implementation of MD and an automated location of transition states using the nudged elastic band method. We study two Sigma=5 [001] symmetric tilt GB's in Cu, with atomic interactions described by an embedded-atom potential. Our simulations demonstrate that GB's support both vacancies and interstitials, and that vacancies can show interesting effects such as delocalization and instability at certain GB sites. Besides simple vacancy-atom exchanges, vacancies move by "long jumps" involving a concerted motion of two atoms. Interstitials move through concerted displacements of two or more atoms. More complex mechanisms (such as ring processes) involving larger groups of atoms have also been found. The obtained point defect formation energies and entropies, as well as their migration rate constants calculated within harmonic transition state theory, are used as input to KMC simulations of GB diffusion. The simulations show that GB diffusion can be dominated by either vacancy or interstitial-related mechanisms depending on the GB structure. The KMC simulations also reveal interesting effects such as temperature-dependent correlation factors and the trapping effect. Using the same simulation approach we study mechanisms of point defect generation in GB's and show that such mechanisms also involve collective transitions.},
