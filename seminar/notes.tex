	\begin{subsection}{Cartilage Tissue Engineering}
		Motivation: Osteoarthritis (OA)

		Nearly 1 in 2 people could develop symptomatic knee OA by 85 years old.

		Purdue solution: Take stem cells with solution of specially engineered proteins, attempt to make the cells grow in a structured matrix.

		Use bacteria to produce proteins for the bioactivematrix

		Used Resilin, which has a high stiffness, and is resilient

		Characterization- Rapid crosslinking of Resilin-based biomaterials

		There is a graph with unlabeled data sets. 

		Cell Interactions- 

		Peptide screening
